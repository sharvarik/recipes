INGREDIENTS (measuring cup used, 1 cup = 250 ml)
4 cups water
3 to 4 tsp black tea leaves
2 inch ginger for a strong taste or 1 inch ginger for a milder taste, peeled & either crushed or grated.
3-4 cardamom, crushed or powdered in a mortar-pestle(optional)
½ to ¾ cup regular milk or cashew milk or soy milk - add more if you want a milky tea
8 tsp unrefined organic cane sugar or add more for more sweetness
INSTRUCTIONS
In a saucepan or kettle, add the water, ginger and crushed cardamom with the peel.
boil this water-ginger-cardamom mixture for a good 6-7 minutes, till the color of the water changes to a mild yellowish hue. the ginger releases its juices & flavors in the water and thus the color of the water changes.
add sugar and simmer for a more of 1-2 minutes.
now add the tea leaves and simmer for about 1 to 2 minutes till the water gets a deep hue of red.
simmering makes the tea strong. if you prefer a light version, then just add the tea leaves to the water. cover and allow the tea leaves to steep in the hot spiced water for 3 to 4 minutes.
add hot milk and then strain the tea,
if adding cold milk, then simmer for a minute or two.
if using cashew milk or almond milk, then just stir the cashew milk with tea and remove from pan as otherwise heating further would cause the cashew or almond milk to become slimy and separate.
strain the tea through a strainer right into the cups.
serve the hot ginger tea or chai or adrak chai with indian snacks like pakoras or samosas. you could also serve the ginger tea with biscuits or cookies.
